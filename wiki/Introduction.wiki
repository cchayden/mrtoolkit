== Overview of MRToolkit ==


*MRToolkit* is a framework for simplifying building jobs to run on the [http://hadoop.apache.org/ Hadoop] Map/Reduce system.  MRToolkit builds on Hadoop [http://hadoop.apache.org/core/docs/current/streaming.html Streaming], which allows you to write separate map and reduce jobs that operate through standard input and output.

MRToolkit is built with [http://www.ruby-lang.org ruby]: you use ruby to write the map and reduce steps, and MRToolkit, streaming, and Hadoop do the rest.

Just to give a taste of how simple it can be, here is a complete map/reduce program:
{{{
require 'mrtoolkit'

class MainJob < JobBase
  def job
    mapper CopyMap
    reducer UniqueCountReduce
    indir "logs"
    outdir "ip"
  end
end


MainJob.run_command(__FILE__)
}}}

This program goes through a set of (slightly modified) Apache log files, and produces a list of all the unique IP addresses, along with a count of how many times each one was used.

== Acknowledgements ==
MRToolkit was inspired by Goolge's [http://labs.google.com/papers/sawzall.html Sawzall].  We wanted to make it even easier by making use of an existing language, rather than inventing a new one.  Ruby was a perfect fit.
