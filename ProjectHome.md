MRToolkit provides a framework for building simple Map/Reduce jobs in just a few lines of code.  You provide only the map and reduce logic, the framework does the rest.  Or use one of the provided map or reduce tools, and write even less.

Map and reduce jobs are written in Ruby.  MRToolkit was inspired by Google's Sawzall.
